### Overview

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your relationship with [http://leadchase.ai](http://leadchase.ai/) website, operated by Leadchase (“Leadchase”, "we", "us" or "our").

Please read these Terms carefully before using the Service.

Your access to and use of the Service is based on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.

By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms and accept all legal consequences. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, in whole or in part, please do not use the Service.

### Subscriptions

Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.

At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew unless you or we cancel it prior to the renewal. You may cancel your Subscription either through your online account management page or by contacting our customer support team. We may cancel by giving you notice of our intent not to renew. We reserve the right to revise the terms of your Subscription, including pricing, upon a renewal of your Subscription by giving you notice of the revision(s) prior to that renewal. If you do not accept the revision(s), you may cancel your Subscription as provided above. If you do not cancel your Subscription prior to the renewal, you will be bound by the revised terms of your Subscription.

We reserve the right to revise the terms of your Subscription upon a renewal of your Subscription by giving reasonable prior notice of the change to give you an opportunity to cancel your Subscription before the change becomes effective upon the renewal. If you do not accept the change, you may cancel your Subscription as provided above. If you do not cancel your Subscription prior to the renewal, you will be bound by the revised terms of your Subscription.

A valid payment method (such as a credit card) is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You will provide us, or the payment services provider, with accurate and complete payment information required by the payment method (such as name, address and telephone number). By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize us to charge all Subscription fees plus applicable Taxes incurred through your account to any such payment method.

If Leadchase is obligated to collect or pay any sales, use, value-added or other taxes (“Taxes”) in respect of your Subscription (other than on Leadchase’s net income), the Taxes will be invoiced to you along with the Subscription fee. To allow us to determine our obligations for Taxes, you agree that we may rely on the address you provide when you subscribe or the address attached to your payment method. If those addresses do not correctly identify the province, territory, state or country of your residence, then you will provide the correct information to us. You will be liable to pay, or reimburse Leadchase, for any Taxes, interest or fines arising out of your failure to provide the correct Tax identification information to us.

Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, we will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.

### Free Trial

Leadchase may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial").

You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.

If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees plus applicable Taxes, for the type of Subscription you have selected.

At any time and without notice, we reserve the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.

### Fee Changes

Leadchase, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.

Leadchase will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.

Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.

### Refunds

Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by Leadchase on a case-by-case basis and granted in sole discretion of Leadchase.
